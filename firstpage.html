        <h1>Analog Synthesizers, Synthesis and Electronic Music</h1>

        <h2>Analog Synthesizers</h2>
        <p> A synthesizer is basically an instrument made of different
            interconnected sections designed to generate and alter the
            properties of sounds.
        </p>
        <p>Analog synthesizers are made of electronic components arranged
            in way that the sound produced or altered is directly related
            to the voltage and current running in the circuitry.
        </p>
        <p>Digital synthesizers include pre-made integrated circuits
            in it's construction and tend to sound different. Some people
            argue that analog generated sounds are more pleasing to the ear.
        </p>

        <h2>Synthesis</h2>
        <p>Synthesizing a sound means that we take use some form of signal
            generator to output a tone so that we can shape its form.
        </p>
        <p>The classical tones that most synthesizers present are made of
            sine waves, saw waves, triangle waves and square waves. These
            tones are, then, directed to other parts of the synthesizer so
            properties - like duration, decay, sustain, frequency filtering
            and others - can be altered. These alterations are made by
            specialized modules, built with a specific function in mind.
        </p>

        <p>Here, we are going to give a special attention to Modular Analog
            Synthesizers due to their incredible versatility, freedom of
            creation and range from simple to complex sound creation.
        </p>
        <p>In a modular system, the "parts" that generate or alter sound 
            are called Modules. Each module present specific functions and
            connections so you can route the sound signal as you please.
        </p>

        <p>Let's take a look at the most basic modules:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Module</strong></th>
                <th><strong>Function</strong></th>
                <th><strong>Parameters</strong></th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>VCO - Voltage Controlled Oscillator</td>
                <td>Generate tones</td>
                <td>Pitch control, fine tuning, CV inputs, FM inputs, waves outputs</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>VCF - Voltage Controlled Filter</td>
                <td>Filter frequencies - High, Band or Low Pass</td>
                <td>Filter Cutoff, Resonance, CV inputs and outputs, LFO inputs</td>                
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Envelope Generator - ASDR Generator</td>
                <td>Adjust time of Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release of a sound</td>
                <td>Attack Time, Sustain Time, Decay Time, Release Time, CV inputs and outputs, LFO inputs</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Low Frequency Oscillator - LFO</td>
                <td>Generate a signal which amplitude varies slowly and in a specific shape</td>
                <td>Time, shape outputs, CV inputs</td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </p>

        <h2>Types of Synthesis</h2>
        <p>There are different approaches to sound synthesis and each uses different
            processes to produce a sound. Here is a list of the most basic ways to synthesize:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Subtractive</li>
            <li>Additive</li>
            <li>Granular</li>
            <li>Sampling</li>
            <li>Frequency Modulation</li>
            <li>Amplitude Modulation</li>
            <li>Wavetable Synthesis</li>
        </ul>
